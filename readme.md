This repo is used to create a simple searchable csv file, where all 'postcode6' areas of Amsterdam are listed.

The list can be used to see how many households/people live in each area, and can give in indication of the GDPR/AVG sensitivity of data about these areas.

The list is based on the CBS kerngetallen data from 2020.

The Python file is intended to be opened/hosted with Streamlit.
