This repo is used to create a simple searchable list with all 'postcode6' areas of Amsterdam.

The list can be used to see how many households/people live in each area, and can give in indication of the GDPR/AVG sensitivity of any data about these areas.

The list is based on the CBS kerngetallen data from 2020.

The Python file is intended to be opened/hosted with Streamlit. See the result [here](https://jongstra-amsterdam-pc6-ge-amsterdam-postcode6-avg-filter-u8dyei.streamlitapp.com/){:target="_blank"}.
